****** Being Migrated to RAILS 3 *****

=== Welcome to Bugs On RAILS

It's a simple bug tracking tool that I hacked up using Ruby on RAILS.

It has served its purpose very well as I and others in my team are effectively 
using this tool to track defects and change requests for our project.

Key features:
- Manage members
- Manage releases
- Dashboard view of defects (similar to card wall in Scrum)
- List view of defects and with filtering options
- Ability to record code review comments, developer notes for each defect.

To set it up, perform following steps:

1. Download the TAR file and extract to a folder "bugsonrails"
2. Change the config/database.yml if you don' want to use sqlite
3. Create database
   rake db:migrate
4. Create an admin user (Until I fix it, here are crude steps)
   script/console
   m = Member.new
   m.id = 1
   m.nickname = 'admin'
   m.name = 'Administrator'
   m.admin = true
   m.save!
   exit

5. Install missing gems
   
   rake gems:install

6. Start the server
   mongrel_rails start

7. visit http://localhost:3000/bugs
8. Login with user id "admin" (no password).  Login is valid for 1 month
